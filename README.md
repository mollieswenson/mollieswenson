Hi! Thanks for reviewing my portfolio. Below are my techical documentation projects.

# xPico200 Series SDK Guide

This multi-page html [SDK guide](https://docs.lantronix.com/products/xpico-200/sdk/1.7/) teaches SDK users how to create, build, and  deploy firmware to an embedded gateway device. Here's what the SDK includes:

* Detailed information about the SDK's modular/component-based architecture, and steps to create modules, build projects, and load firmaware. See [Creating Modules](https://docs.lantronix.com/products/xpico-200/sdk/1.7/modules/), [Building Projects](https://docs.lantronix.com/products/xpico-200/sdk/1.7/projects/), and [Loading Firmware](https://docs.lantronix.com/products/xpico-200/sdk/1.7/firmware/). 
* Line-by-line descriptions of the C-language code in the sample applications packaged with the SDK. See [Sample Applications](https://docs.lantronix.com/products/xpico-200/sdk/1.7/sample-apps/). 
* An automatically-generated developer reference that includes function documentation for all modules, including descriptions, parameters, data types, and returns. Additionally, the developer reference includes information about data structures and header files. This documentation is generated by Doxygen as as HTML output, and then manipulated using Python to prepare the HTML for inclusion in the SDK Guide files. See [Developer Reference](https://docs.lantronix.com/products/xpico-200/sdk/1.7/dev-ref/).

# FoodTruck API

This single-page html [API documentation](https://mollieswenson.github.io/slate/) includes Node (JavaScript), Python, and cURL code samples for all GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE API operations, as well as information on authentication, errors, and an overview. It is written in Markdown and published using Slate.

I wrote the code for the FoodTruck API as part of a course on API development! It uses Node with Express and MongoDB. See the [code on GitHub](https://github.com/mollieswenson/foodtruck-api).

# Video Search App

This [React component wiki](https://github.com/mollieswenson/react-video-search-app/wiki) documents the React components used in a video search app, including property name, type, description, initial state, and state change functions. It's written in Markdown and published using GitHub Wiki.

I wrote this app as part of a course on React. It makes calls to the YouTube API and updates the search results as the user types. See the [code on GitHub](https://github.com/mollieswenson/react-video-search-app).

# Therapist Bot App

This [code documentation](https://github.com/mollieswenson/therapist-bot/#therapist-bot-code-docs) records the constants, functions, and enumerations used in the JavaScript code of this application. It's written in Markdown and published as the project readme.

I wrote this app for a course on code documentation. The app is a (mildly rude) therapist who is happy to discuss your problems for hours on end. A working [demo therapy session](https://mollieswenson.github.io/therapist-bot/) and the [code](https://github.com/mollieswenson/therapist-bot) are on GitHub.

# Taxify API

This html [API reference](https://mollieswenson.github.io/taxify-api-docs/) includes a name, description method, URL, parameters (with parameter name, type, required, and description), sample cURL request, and sample JSON response for each Taxify API endpoint. It's written in Markdown and published using GitHub Pages.

# More Projects

The above projects best represent my current skills and career direction. However, I have several other samples if you'd like to see more.

[Sound Board App](https://mollieswenson.github.io/soundboard/): I wrote this JavaScript App so that my D&D group could have a cool soundboard when we get together. It uses JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, and CSS. The [source](https://github.com/mollieswenson/soundboard) is on GitHub.

[Google Apps eLearning](resources/google-apps-elearning.pdf): This eLearning course was created using Articulate Studio. It's purpose was to prepare about 15,000 employees for a company-wide transition of several communication and collaboration tools.

[Google Apps Instructor-Led Training](resources/google-apps-presentation.pdf): This live-training presentation was presented as part of live company-wide transition of several communication and collaboration tools. The PDF includes notes for the instructor to read during the presentation.

[Tutorial Video for Minecraft Residence Plugin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6EY6Xi0fcM&index=4&list=PL750FA9D10C3FE159): I had a Minecraft server and YouTube channel where I posted videos about it. This one describes how to use commands for a plugin available on the server. The audience is a bunch of fairly young gamers who are already familiar with typing commands with parameters.

[TaxCaddy CPA User Guide](resources/taxcaddy-user-guide.pdf): This PDF user guide teaches CPAs how to use a new product (TaxCaddy) that integrates with a product they already have (FileRoom SPbinder). It assumes the audience is non-technical and includes a lot of screenshots to help orient users.

[TaxCaddy Taxpayer Help Center](https://helpcenter.taxcaddy.com/hc/en-us): This help center website was created using ZenDesk. Audience analysis revealed that the average TaxCaddy user is 45+ and not very computer-savvy, so the help center includes simple, clear instructions and plenty of screenshots. I wrote all the articles on the help center through June 2017.

[Account Access Quick Start Guide](resources/okta-quick-start.pdf): This quick start guide walks employees through the process of using OKTA (single sign-on tool) to access their account. This guide was used by all employees during a company-wide transition and assumed some users were not very technical.
