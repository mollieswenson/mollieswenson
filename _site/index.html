      <h1 id="projects">Projects</h1>

<p>Hi! Thanks for reviewing my portfolio. Below are my API, SDK, and code documentation projects. Each has a link to the related docs and any code I wrote as well.</p>

<h2 id="foodtruck-api">FoodTruck API</h2>

<p>This single-page html <a href="https://mollieswenson.github.io/slate/">API documentation</a> includes Node (JavaScript), Python, and cURL code samples for all GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE API operations, as well as info on authentication, errors, and an overview. It is written in Markdown and published using Slate.</p>

<p>I wrote the code for the FoodTruck API as part of a course on API development! It uses Node with Express and MongoDB. You can make working API calls and see the the <a href="https://github.com/mollieswenson/foodtruck-api">code on GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2 id="aperture-science-sdk">Aperture Science SDK</h2>

<p>This multi-page html <a href="https://mollieswenson.github.io/aperture-science-sdk/">SDK guide</a> includes an overview, getting started, tutorials, sample applications, and an API reference. It’s written in Markdown and published using Mkdocs.</p>

<h2 id="taxify-api">Taxify API</h2>

<p>This html <a href="https://mollieswenson.github.io/taxify-api-docs/">API reference</a> includes a name, description method, url, parameters (with parameter name, type, required, and description), sample cURL request, and sample JSON response for each Taxify API endpoint. It’s written in Markdown, uses custom CSS, and published using Atom markdown-themeable-PDF package.</p>

<h2 id="video-search-app">Video Search App</h2>

<p>This PDF <a href="https://github.com/mollieswenson/react-video-search-app/blob/master/React%20video%20search%20app%20documentation.pdf">React component reference</a> documents the React components used in a video search app, including property name, type, description, initial state, and state change functions.</p>

<p>I wrote this app as part of a course on React. It makes calls to the YouTube API and updates the search results as the user types. See the <a href="https://github.com/mollieswenson/react-video-search-app">code on GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2 id="therapist-bot-app">Therapist Bot App</h2>

<p>This PDF <a href="https://github.com/mollieswenson/therapist-bot/blob/master/Therapist%20Bot%20Documentation.pdf">code documentation</a> records the constants, functions, and enumerations used in the JavaScript code of this application.</p>

<p>I wrote this app for a course on code documentation. The app is a (mildly rude) therapist who is happy to discuss your problems for hours on end. A working <a href="https://mollieswenson.github.io/therapist-bot/">demo therapy session</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/mollieswenson/therapist-bot">code</a> are on GitHub.</p>

<h2 id="more-projects">More Projects</h2>

<p>The above projects best represent my current skills and carreer direction. However, I have several other samples if you’d like to see more.</p>

<p><a href="http://recrs.org">DnD Sound Board App</a>: I wrote this JavaScript App so that my DnD group could have a cool soundboard when we get together. It uses JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, and CSS. The <a href="https://github.com/mollieswenson/soundboard">source</a> is on GitHub.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6EY6Xi0fcM&amp;index=4&amp;list=PL750FA9D10C3FE159">Tutorial Video for Minecraft Residence Plugin</a>: I  had a Mincraft server and YouTube channel where I posted videos about it. This one describes how to use commands for a plugin available on the server. The audience is a bunch of fairly young gamers who are already familair with typing commands with parameters.</p>

<p><a href="docs/taxcaddy-user-guide.pdf">TaxCaddy CPA User Guide</a>: This PDF user guide teaches CPAs how to use a new product (TaxCaddy) that integrates with a product they already have (FileRoom SPbinder). It assumes the audience is non-technical and includes a lot of screenshots to help orient users.</p>

<p><a href="https://helpcenter.taxcaddy.com/hc/en-us">TaxCaddy Taxpayer Help Center</a>: This help center website was created using ZenDesk. Audeince analysis revealed that the average TaxCaddy user is 45+ and not very computer-savvy, so the help center includes simple, clear instructions and plenty of screenshots. I wrote all the articles on the help center through June 2017.</p>

<p><a href="docs/okta-quick-start.pdf">Account Access Quick Start Guide</a>: This quick start guide walks employees through the process of using OKTA (single sign-on tool) to access their account. This guide was used by all employees durring a company-wide transition and assumed some users were not very technical.</p>

<p><a href="docs/google-apps-presentation.pdf">Google Apps Instructor-Led Training</a>: This PowerPoint presentation is intended to be presented as part of live training on the company-wide transition of several communication and collaboration tools. The PDF includes notes for the instructor to read durring the presentation.</p>

<p><a href="docs/haas-marketing.pdf"> HaaS Marketing Flyer</a>: Marketing HaaS and professional services to local small businesses.</p>
